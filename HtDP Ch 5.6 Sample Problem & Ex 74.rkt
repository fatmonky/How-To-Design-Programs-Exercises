Sample Problem Your team is designing an interactive game program that moves a red dot across a image canvas and allows players to use the mouse to reset the dot. Here is how far you got together:

    (define MTS (empty-scene 100 100))
    (define DOT (circle 3 "solid" "red"))
     
    ; A Posn represents the state of the world.
     
    ; Posn -> Posn 
    (define (main p0)
      (big-bang p0
        [on-tick x+]
        [on-mouse reset-dot]
        [to-draw scene+dot]))

Your task is to design scene+dot, the function that adds a red dot to the empty canvas at the specified position.


Exercise 74. Copy all relevant constant and function definitions to DrRacketâ€™s definitions area.
 Add the tests and make sure they pass. Then run the program and use the mouse to place the red dot. 
|#

(define MTS (empty-scene 100 100))
(define DOT (circle 3 "solid" "red"))
 
; A Posn represents the state of the world.
 
; Posn -> Posn 
(define (main p0) ;in interaction area, type (main (make-posn 0 0)) to start
  (big-bang p0
    [on-tick x+]
    [on-mouse reset-dot]
    [to-draw scene+dot]))

; Posn -> Image
; adds a red spot to MTS at p
(check-expect (scene+dot (make-posn 10 20))
              (place-image DOT 10 20 MTS))
(check-expect (scene+dot (make-posn 88 73))
              (place-image DOT 88 73 MTS))
(define (scene+dot p)
  (place-image DOT (posn-x p) (posn-y p) MTS))

; Posn -> Posn
; increases the x-coordinate of p by 3
(check-expect (x+ (make-posn 10 0)) (make-posn 13 0))
(define (x+ p)
  (posn-up-x p (+ (posn-x p) 3)))

#|Exercise 73. Design the function posn-up-x, which consumes a Posn p and a Number n. It produces a Posn like p with n in the x field.
|#

;Posn n -> Posn
; updater/functional setter
(define (posn-up-x p n)
  (make-posn n (posn-y p)))

; Posn Number Number MouseEvt -> Posn 
; for mouse clicks, (make-posn x y); otherwise p
(check-expect
  (reset-dot (make-posn 10 20) 29 31 "button-down")
  (make-posn 29 31))
(check-expect
  (reset-dot (make-posn 10 20) 29 31 "button-up")
  (make-posn 10 20))
(define (reset-dot p x y me)
  (cond
    [(mouse=? me "button-down") (make-posn x y)]
    [else p]))
