R1D2, 3/1/21: Completed Ex 53, Sample Ex 4.4<br />
R1D3, 4/1/21: Completed Ex 54-55. <br />
R1D4, 6/1/21: Stuck on Ex 56-57. Running (main2 "resting") leads to
'<=: expects a real as 1st argument, given "resting" '. <br />
R1D5, 7/1/21: Completed Ex 56: got it to work, with "resting" as arg for main2 function. <br />
7/1/21 Part 2: Had a go at Ex 57, am stuck with the other definition of height. <br />
R1D6, 8/1/21: Completed Ex 57 using the other definition of height. Also completed 4.6 Sample Ex and Ex 58. <br /> 
R1D7, 9/1/21: Completed Ex 59 & 60. <br />
R1D8, 10/1/21: Completed Ex 61, am still working on Ch 4.7 Sample Problem. I am trying to work it out by myself, rather than reading and following the text first.<br />
R1D9, 11/1/21: Still working on Ch 4.7 Sample Problem. Got my unit tests worked out, but still getting an error message, rather than for the "door" to work properly. <br />
